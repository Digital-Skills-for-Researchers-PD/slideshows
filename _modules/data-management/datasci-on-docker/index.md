      # Data Science on Docker

  - content: |

      Our goal is a computer inside our computer. This is known as a virtual machine.
  
  - content: |

      The Virtual machine runs in a window, like any other application, but it is a whole operating system.

  - content: |

      The virtual machine will run Linux and have all the data sci tools we need.

  - content: |

      This keeps our Data Sci setup separate from our normal computer system.

  - content: |

      The tool we have chosen to use to manage our VM is Docker.

      Docker will set up an Ubuntu virtual machine for you.

  - content: |

      Skip the DockerHub integration.

      ## Set up the VM from image


  - content: |

  - content: |

      Click "create"

      ## Shutting Down Ubuntu

      Running a VM takes a lot of processing power, shutting it down gives your computer a break.
