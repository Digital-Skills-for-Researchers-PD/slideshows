      # Repositories
      _And other terminology_


  - content: |

      **A Git repository is roughly**
      **equivalent to a project folder.**

      One project, one repository.

  - content: |

      A repository contains files,
      and history about those files.

      ## Structure of a Repository

  - content: |

      A repository can be created from the command line,
      by running `git init` inside your project folder.

  - content: |

      Running `git init` creates a hidden 
      folder called `.git` inside your project.

  - content: |

      The hidden `.git` folder contains files which track
      your project's status, changes, and other git-related stuff.

  - content: |

      Deleting the hidden `.git` file will erase your
      git history, making your folder "normal" again.

  - content: |

      You can only run git commands in a folder 
      where there is an existing git repository.

      That is, you have to `git init`
      before you can use Git for a project!
