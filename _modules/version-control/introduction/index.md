      Version Control addresses all of these problems, and more.

      ## A Version Control System is a piece of software
      It runs on your computer like any other software


  - content: |

      It allows you to create backup points at any time.


  - content: |

      It can show you each of the changes 
      you've made since your last backup.

  - content: |

      It lets you time travel.


  - content: |

      It can send files to a remote backup location.

      ## Git is a Version Control System

      Another popular system is Mercurial,
      but Git is currently the most popular.


  - content: |

      Git is free software, which you can
      download and install on your computer.


  - content: |

      You can interact with Git using the command line.


  - content: |

      You can also interact with Git using an app interface.

      ## GitHub is a Remote Backup Service for Git

  - content: |

      GitHub is a service to store Git repositories in the cloud,
      just like Gmail is a service to store email in the cloud.

  - content: |

      Another popular service is BitBucket. 
      They're the same but different.






  - content: |

      ## Git and GitHub work together

      Git manages your project files on your computer.
      GitHub is for backups, collaboration and publishing.


  - content: |

      You can tell Git to send 
      your files to GitHub any time.

  - content: |

      Files on GitHub can be accessed 
      by other team members.

      They can also be open to public view.

      ## Git and GitHub solve our common issues

      Our project is tidier, our backups are well-managed,
      and all team members have visibility of the project state.


  - content: |

      **Situation 1: Copy Paste - SOLVED**
      
      Git keeps copies for us, letting us focus 
      on the current version at all times.

      **Situation 2: But it was there yesterday! - SOLVED**
      
      Git allows us to view timestamped versions,
      and recover anything we accidentally deleted.

      **Situation 3: Sad Laptop - SOLVED**
      
      Pushing to GitHub creates a remote backup,
      which we can copy to a new computer if needed.
