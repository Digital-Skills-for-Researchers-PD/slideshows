        # Creating a GitHub Account
        _A step by step guide_

        GitHub is a hosting service for Git,
        just as Gmail is a hosting service for email.

      notes: |

        There are other Git hosting services, for example
        BitBucket and Beanstalk are two of the more popular ones.

        GitHub is the most popular Git platform for open source
        projects.

        Your GitHub Account is your public profile
        for all code projects you own or contribute to.

        ## Sign Up for GitHub

        Go to the [GitHub Home Page](https://github.com/) and fill in your details.

        Your username will also be used as your GitHub web address.


      notes: |

        Your username can be changed later, though it is not recommended as it can sometimes break some links within GitHub.

        Choose a short and memorable username you won't be embarrassed to share in a professional setting.

        Choose the free account and click "Finish sign up".

      notes: |

        Free accounts allow you to have unlimited public projects,
        but if you'd like to have private projects then you will
        need to change to a paid account.

        ## Verify Your Email Address

        GitHub will have sent you an account confirmation email.
        Open the email and click "Verify Email Address"

        You should be taken to your GitHub home page.

      notes: |

        Some GitHub features will not work correctly until you
        verify your account, so it would be a good idea to do
        this as soon as possible.

        ### Profile Picture

        Your profile picture will be displayed alongside 
        your username for any activity you do on GitHub.

        Uploading a picture is optional.

        ### Name

        You name will be displayed publicly.

        Most people use their real full name to make
        it easy for others to find them.

        You can use a false name or pseudonym if you prefer.

        ### Public Email

        Showing your email address on your profile is optional.
        We recommend selecting "Don't show my email address".

        If you have a personal website you'd like to promote
        to other GitHub users, you can enter it here.

        This field is optional, and is for making it easier
        for GitHub users to identify each other.

        ### Location

        This field is optional.
        It can also be as detailed or as vague as you like.

        Many users simply enter their country.
