      notes: |
        This is a bit of an oversimplification. Its okay to make a graphic "junkier" if you feel it needs to be more striking or memorable. It is a trade off.

        ## Encoding with size

        Graphic dimension <= Data dimension

        ## Iterate

        + You are probably not going to get it right the first time.

        + What makes sense to you wont necessarily make sense to others. 

      notes: |
        Creating your figures using script in R/Python etc makes iteration very easy.

        Validate your design decisions, particularily on more complex graphics.

        ## Aesthetics

      notes: |
        Don't be afraid of spending time to make your graphics look nice beyond the point of a servicable level of prettyness. Going beyond this point isnt [something], Make graphics that people want to look at.

        ## Tables

        + If you can effectively convey information with a graph, use a graph

        + Tables still have a place, most often as a reference

        ## General rules for using tables
        * Several smaller tables are better than one large table
        * Structure the table for how your audience will use the data
        * Arrange rows and columns by some sort of context - size, name etc

        ## Use an Anchor figure
        Hilight the principle data points you want compared to the rest of the data

        ## Colour lines
        Improves readability remarkably, especially for larger tables

        ## Combine Tables and Graphs
        Show trends/patterns in data as well as exact values

        ## Sparklines   
        Show shape and variation of data

        ## Explore your options, there is a whole [zoo](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1805128) of choices out there
        There might not be an established solution yet  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ so be creative
