        ## The Science of Perception and Visualization

        Human perception important aspect of visualization
        Pre attentive processing: low level visual system rapidly processes certain basic features of an image (<200 ms).

        Variety of theories for how and why.

        Do this without thinking.

      notes: |
        How we process visual information has a big impact on designing effective visualizations

        When we think about the process of vision and perception we have two categories of perception, uncontrolled(pre attentive) and controlled (attentive)

        Attentive perception transforms the low level features from pre attentive into higher order features and representations.

        Its no coincidence that alot of the markers and channels we use in visualization are objects and distinctions we pre-attentively process.

        ## Post attentive visualization 

      notes: |
        What happens after that initial glance at something if we go and look at something else?
        It appears that we don't start to build up an even richer visual representation of something [Wolfe (2000)](http://search.bwh.harvard.edu/new/pubs/postattentiveJEPHPP.pdf). 

        If we are pay close attention to a graphic and try and search for features and information, post attentively searching, finding what we are looking for takes as long or longer as the first, pre attentive, glance. 

        We can see this our selves with the change blindness phenomena.

        When we are presenting a visualisation to a viewer it will generally be novel for them, they wont have seen it before. We can't rely on the viewer having some prior knowledge or guidance avout where to look at or for in a graphic.

        Studying a graphic may give no help in searching for specific data values.

        If we want the viewing to be drawn to things need to use pre attentive processing

        From [Ceveland and McGill](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/courses/cpsc533c-04-spr/readings/cleveland.pdf)

        1. Position along a common scale
        2. Positions along non-aligned scales
        3. Length, direction, angle
        4. Area
        5. Volume, curvature
        6. Shading, colour saturation
