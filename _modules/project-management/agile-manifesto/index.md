      ## Once upon a time, in a ski resort far, far away...

      Seventeen project management practitioners held a summit.
      
      The participants didn't agree about much, but they found 
      consensus around **4 main values** and **12 guiding priciples**.

      And so, the Agile Manifesto was created.

    notes: |

      The Agile Manifesto was written in February of 2001, at a summit of 17 independent-minded practitioners of several programming methodologies. 

      These 4 main values drove out 12 principles as a guide to iterative and people centric approach to software development. This formed the basis of the foundation for the Agile movement.

      ## The 4 values

      **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

      **Working software** over comprehensive documentation

      **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

      **Responding to change** over following a plan 
      {:.fragment}

    notes: |

      That is, while there is value in the items on the right, Agile values the items on the left more.

      Almost everyone will agree with these values in theory, but it rarely shows in their practice. As an Agile practitioner you should regularly ask yourself whether you are adhering to these values in your daily activities.

      ### Individuals and interactions
      **over processes and tools**

      The very best processes and tools are worthless 
      without the right team and effective communication.

    notes: |

      There is value in processes and tools, but Agile places _more_ value on individuals and interactions.

      You may have the very best software, hardware, tools and processes in the world, but they are worthless without the right team and effective communication between team members.

      People often believe that doubling the number of people assigned to a task will result in the task being completed twice as fast. This is rarely the case, and is a concept discussed in-depth in the essay _"The Mythical Man Month"_.

      Processes and tools are important, but individuals and interactions are the priority.

      ### Working software
      **over comprehensive documentation**

      Documentation is worthless if the 
      system doesn't work or is incomplete.
    
    notes: |

      There is value in documentation, but Agile places _more_ value on working software.

      Detailed documentation of a project or a piece of software is very helpful for people new to the system, but documentation is worthless if the system doesn't work or is incomplete.

      Documentation is important, but a working piece of software is the priority.

      ### Customer collaboration 
      **over contract negotiation**

      To deliver a truly useful final product, the conversation needs 
      to be ongoing and the team needs to practice adaptibility.

    notes: |

      There is value in a contract, but Agile places _more_ value on collaboration with the customer.

      A contract allows everyone to have an understanding of their rights and responsibilities, but it's important to understand that the customer's requirements may change, priorities may shift, and the contract likely didn't get everything right up-front.

      Successful developers work closely with customers to uncover what the customer needs, and to involve them and educate them along the way. To deliver a truly useful final product, the conversation needs to be ongoing and the team needs to practice adaptibility. 

      Contracts are important, but a contract isn't a substitute for effective communication.

      ### Responding to change 
      **over following a plan**

      Change is a reality of software development, 
      and your process must reflect that reality.
    
    notes: |

      There is value in following a plan, but Agile places _more_ value on responding well to change.
      
      People change their priorities for a variety of reasons. As work progresses on your system your project stakeholder’s understanding of the problem domain and of what you are building changes. The business environment changes. Technology changes over time, although not always for the better. Change is a reality of software development, a reality that your software process must reflect. 
      
      There is nothing wrong with having a project plan, in fact I would be worried about any project that didn’t have one. However, a project plan must be malleable, there must be room to change it as your situation changes otherwise your plan quickly becomes irrelevant.


      Having a plan is important, but being able to respond to change is even more important.

      {:.horizontal-list style="width:700px"}

    notes: |

      The manifesto also defines 12 guiding principles, which are designed to help people better understand what Agile is all about.

  - content: |

      ### Satisfy The Customer
      The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through 
      early and continuous delivery of valuable software

  - content: |

      ### Welcome Change
      Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. 
      Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

  - content: |

      ### Deliver Frequently
      Deliver working software frequently, according to 
      how quickly the customer can consume it.

  - content: |

      ### Measure of Progress
      Working software is the primary measure of progress.

  - content: |

      ### Motivated People
      Build projects around motivated individuals. 
      
      Give them the environment and support they need, 
      and trust them to get the job done.


  - content: |
  
      ### High Bandwidth
      The most effective method of conveying information to 
      and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

  - content: |
  
      ### Whole Team Daily
      Business people and developers must 
      work together daily throughout the project.

  - content: |
  
      ### Sustainable
      The sponsors, developers and users should be able 
      to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

  - content: |
  
      ### Technical Excellence
      Continuous attention to technical excellence 
      and good design enhances agility.

  - content: |
  
      ### Simplicity
      The art of doing just enough 
      and no more than is necessary.

  - content: |

      ### Self Organising Team
      The best architecture, requirements and designs 
      emerge from self-organising teams.


  - content: |
  
      ### Continuous Improvement
      At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become 
      more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.
