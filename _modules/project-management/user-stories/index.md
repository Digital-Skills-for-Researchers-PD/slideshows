      # User Stories
      _Describing tasks to be done_

      ## Wouldn't it be great if...
      **This is how a user story begins.**

      User stories are To-Do tasks with context.

    notes: |

      We've all been in a situation where we've been using a piece of software and thought "Wouldn't it be great if...".

      These "what ifs" which would improve the user experience or fulfil a need are the essence of user stories in Agile.

      User stories define the person's **role**, their **goal**,
      and the **benefit**, where the benefit is not clear.

      AS A ... [role]
      I WANT ... [goal]
      SO THAT ... [benefit]

      eg. As a vacation traveller, 
      I want to see photos of the hotels

    notes: |

      As a vacation traveller, I want to see photos of the hotels

      As a frequent flyer, I want to rebook a past trip, so that I can save time booking trips I take often

      As a user I want to reserve a hotel room

      As a job seeker I want to submit my CV for suitable jobs

      As a customer I want to transfer money from one account to another

      ## Additional Details
      
      Details for a story may be added as conditions
      of satisfaction, or as acceptance criteria.


    notes: |

      Detail are added in the form of conditions of satisfaction or acceptance criteria

      ## Story Details Example

      As a **user** I want to **cancel a reservation**

      - verify that a premium member can cancel same day with no fee
      - verify that a standard member is charged 10% for same day cancelation 
      - verify that an email confirmation is sent
      - verify that the hotel is notified of any cancellation

      User stories start in the **Project Backlog**
      and then travel through the workflow.

      Project Backlog -> Sprint Backlog -> Doing -> Testing -> Done

      ## A Good User Story

      - Short
      - Clear
      - Conversation Starter   
      - Describes functionality that will be of value to a user

      ## ProTip #1

      Not all stories need to be written in the same format.
      Technical or constraint stories may need a different structure.

      ## ProTip #2

      The story text on the card is less important than 
      the conversations everyone has about the card.

      ## Story Points

      During planning, we give each story a number of **story points**
      which try to estimate the effort required to complete it.

      Story points help us to better plan what we can achieve each sprint.

    notes: |
      Story points are arbitrary measures used by Scrum to measure the effort required to implement a story. It is usually a mix of effort, complexity and uncertainty that is considered when assigning points.

      Once a story point is set for one story it can be used to measure the relative size of the remaining stories.

      Using story points allows teammates with different skill levels to communicate about and agree on estimates at a level playing field. A 5 km run is a five km run for everyone (size and complexity). But some of us will run it faster than others (this is the skill and experience factor).

      It is easier and faster to agree an arbitrary measure than it is to use one based on our own skill and experience and speed level. 

      This agreement makes relative sizing of stories much easier.

      Stakeholders have lots of ideas
      They are not limited to 4-6 ideas per week
      Every time something is delivered they will have new ideas
      These cannot be allowed overload the team
      Remember the teams capacity is 4-6 per week
      Overloading causes
      Multitasking, demotivation, interruptions

      ## what do we build this week

      Team weekly velocity is 4-6 stories
      P.O. needs to work out which 4-6 stories should be built this week
      A backlog is used to queue the stakeholder ideas
      Called a Product Backlog
      Over time can become large
      Items can get ‘old’ in the queue
      P.O needs to have authority to say NO!
