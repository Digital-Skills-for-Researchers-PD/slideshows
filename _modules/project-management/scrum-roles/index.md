      ## Product Owner
      Determines _what_ to build.

      They are an expert in the field in question,
      they own the product vision and the backlog.

    notes: |

      The Product Owner is _not_ the customer. They are a person who can interpret the customer's requirements and produce user stories for the Development Team to implement.

      They must thoroughly understand the Project Vision, as they own the Project Backlog and must make decisions about which user stories are the highest priority. The project's acceptance criteria must also be fully understood by the Product Owner, and taken into consideration when making prioritisation decisions.

      The Development Team may not fully understand the context of the software, so it is the Product Owner's responsibility to ensure the user stories are correctly implemented by the team.

      ## Development Team
      Determines _how_ to build the solution.

      These people turn user stories into working software.
      They are self-organising and own the technical decisions.

    notes: |

      The Development Team:  How to Build it
      Those who turn User Stories into working software
      Cross functional, Multi-disciplined 
      Self-Organising
      Collectively responsible for delivering the product
      Empowered to determine how to deliver
      Optimal size for a Scrum Team is 7 + / - 2

      ## Scrum Master
      Supports the _Agile Process_.

      This person is experienced with the Agile process,
      and coaches the team and customer to function smoothly.

    notes: |

      The Scrum Master is an enabler of Agile teams, as they coach everyone involved to understand their roles and how to follow the Agile process.

      They work to resolve issues which may hold up the team, such as disagreement about priorities or external factors which may upset the flow of work.

      They also protect the team from interference. A Scrum Master has the power and responsibility to prevent too much work from being pushed onto the team, or breaking the iterative cycle, which would defeat the purpose of Agile.

      They help tune and adjust team behaviour.

      ## Conflicts of Interest

      **If a Dev Team member is also the Product Owner**
      ... what might happen?

      **If a Dev Team member is also the Scrum Master**
      ... what might happen?

      **If the Product Owner is also the Scrum Master**
      ... what might happen?

    notes: |

      There are always trade offs between the roles
      Each role has a different focus
      Yes if resources are tight a team member could act as the SM or PO but
      Be aware that there might be and probably will be a conflict of interest at some
      Point in the project that will need to be handled with care.
      Ideally each role is performed by a different person to avoid conflicts of interest.

      ## What we learned

      - **Product Owner**
        Determines _what_ to build, decides project priorities.
      - **Development Team**
        Determines _how_ to build it, produces software.
      - **Scrum Master**
        Supports the _Agile Process_, keeps the team functioning effectively.

    notes: |

      The Product Owner, Dev Team and Scrum Master are very distinct roles with very specific responsibilities.

      It's not uncommon for there to be some crossover of roles, especially in small teams. In these cases we need to be particularly aware of the conflicts of interest between the roles, and be sure to mitigate them where possible.
