      ## The Elevator Pitch

      This short speech should be used to convince someone of the 
      validity and importance of your project in 30 seconds or less.

    notes: |

      You should be able to deliver this short product overview in the time it takes to ride an elevator, hence the name "Elevator Pitch".

      The pitch should be interesting, memorable, and succinct. You may have slightly different elevator pitches depending on the audience you're speaking to.

      A pitch doesn't need to tell the whole story. Instead, it should capture the listener's attention so that they are interested in continuing the conversation and asking more about the product.

      Your pitch will likely evolve over time as your project or product changes.

      **Boring:** 
      My product is a mobile pet camera.

      **Better:** 
      My product allows pet owners to check in on their pets any time of day, 
      right from their mobile device. 
      
      This allows people peace of mind that their pet is safe and happy, 
      resulting in less stress and more flexibility of schedule for 
      busy pet owners.

      ### Planning Your Pitch

      - Who is your target customer?
      - What does your product do?
      - What problem does it solve, or what benefit does it provide?
      - What is its unique value over other products?
      - Is there an interesting statistic you can include?

      ### Presentational vs Conversational

      A **presentational** elevator pitch should be more formal
      and could be used in a presentation or on a website.

      A **conversational** elevator pitch should feel natural
      when mingled with everyday conversation.


    notes: |

      When having a conversation with someone, you should be speaking *with* them, not *at* them.

      Your conversational pitch is the response you give when someone asks "What do you do?" or "What are you working on?".

      When presenting an idea to a group of people there is less opportunity for conversation, so the structure of the pitch needs to reflect that.

      ### Building your Presentation Pitch

      **Problem**. **Solution**.
      Create stunning visual maps to compare action potential propagation time between multiple electrodes.

      **How**. **Extra benefit**.
      FinchNet supports multiple electrodes, relative electrode positioning and accurate identification of peaks and troughs in extracellular traces. Find the data you need with no programming required.

      **Statistic**.
      99% of neuroscientists say FinchNet is the best app ever.

    notes: |

      This is how you describe your product to your target audience so that they understand the benefit to them.

      ### Building your Conversation Pitch
      
      **What do you do?**
      I'm working on an app where you give it data from a finch's brain, and it tells you how good the bird is at figuring out which direction a sound is coming from.

      **Whoa! How do you do that?**
      Well, sound enters the bird's two ears at slightly different times, depending where the sound came from. We can measure that time difference using electrodes, and we can also measure how long it takes the information to travel through the brain to the sound processing centre.

      **Okay, but why are you studying that?**
      Great question, how does this apply to further research? What do we gain? Where to from here?


    notes: |

      No big words. No jargon. Explain it like I'm 5.

      This is how you explain your project in an everyday conversation with someone who is not necessarily in science.

      1. **Start with a "Wow"** - capture their interest with what you do
      2. **Then a "How"** - how you do your thing, and how it benefits them
      3. **Finally a "Now"** - now, for example... tell a good story!


    notes: |

      Avoid being the boring 60 second “talking brochure”, instead remember:

      1. CONVERSATIONS.  The goal is not to deliver your 60 second advertisement; it’s to have a two-way conversation.  A successful pitch is where the other person relaxes and says “Interesting. Tell me more.”

      2. SHORT. 60 seconds is a long time to talk uninterrupted. An elevator pitch is NOT a sales pitch. Think 10 seconds, not 60!

      3. EVERYDAY LANGUAGE. Avoid words like “synergy”, “optimize”, “efficiency”, “ROI” and so on. These words SCREAM “sales pitch” and will have your panicked prospect looking for the exit signs.
