      # Team Charters
      _Defining Team Expectations_

    notes: |

      The team charter is a document which is written collaboratively by the team, and defines the team's expectations and values which everyone agrees to follow.

      This presentation will look at the different apects of the team charter and how one could be created to fit your own team.

      The **Team Charter** can be thought of as the **foundation** upon which 
      all of the team’s work, rules, tools, and behaviors are built.
  
    notes: |
      
      Team Charters in Agile are slightly different from those you may find in other styles of project management.

      In traditional project management, the charter defines the project scope and success criteria, which is often pre-determined by senior management/sponsors.
      
      In Agile, a Team Charter is built and agreed upon by the project team exclusively.

      A Team Charter doesn't require a lot of detail.
      It should be limited to a high-level vision.
    
    notes: |

      As Agile project management is iterative by nature and evolves throughout the project lifecycle, there is not much need for a great level of detail in the charter. 
      
      In fact, since the charter is created in the beginning of the project, the team may not even know or understand a great level of detail yet. The project specific information that is included in the charter should be limited to a high level vision (why the project has been initiated), a description of the mission or objectives, and what criteria constitute success for the project. 
      
      All of this information is at a high enough level that it should be known to the project team at the outset of the project.

      The team charter has two components:
      The **Project Definition** and the **Team Agreement**.

    notes: |

      The terms "Project Definition" and "Team Agreement" aren't official terms, but they do sum up the two aspects of information covered in the team charter.

      The charter specifies the purpose of the project, and it also specifies the team and team's expectations for working on the project.

      ## Project Definition

      **Project Name**
      The name your team knows the project by.

      **Vision**
      The intended result/outcome of the project, or the problem to be solved.

      **Mission**
      Brief description of the work which will be produced to reach the vision.

      **Success Criteria**
      Measurable outcomes for the project to be considered a success.

    notes: |

      The "Project Definition" part of the charter addresses the purpose of the project and the general game plan for achieving the desired outcomes.

      ## Project Definition Example

      **Project Name**
      Invoice Tracking Database

      **Vision**
      Help the billing department reduce the number of monthly past-due accounts by providing an easy to use platform for tracking accounts receivable.

      **Mission**
      Create an invoice tracking database that enables billing employees to view real-time account statuses, engage vendors proactively to resolve accounts, and generate weekly and monthly account reports.

      **Success Criteria**

      - Implement database by March 1, 2017
      - Reduce monthly past-due accounts by 75% after 3 months
      - Achieve > 80% favorability among billing employees via survey 
        after 3 months


    notes: |

      Note that at a glance the vision and the mission seem quite similar.

      The **vision** should be more broad, defining the problem to be solved and the general agreed approach for solving it.

      The **mission** should define the tangible outcome of the project. It defines **how** the vision will be fulfilled by the project.

      ## Team Agreement Example

      **Behaviour Agreement**

      - We don’t cut Corners
      - Its OK to disagree
      - Don’t assume, ask
      - Check your ego at the door
      - Be fanatical about feedback
      - Treat each other with respect

      **Communication Agreement**

      - Daily meetings on Slack at 9am each work day
      - Make every effort to attend meetings in person
      - Update our kanban board each morning before 9am
      - Team members are expected to be on time for all meetings
      

    notes: |

      A Team Agreement:

      - Outlines behaviour boundaries
      - Shows team support 
      - Commits members to shared values
      - Cultivates desired team behaviours

      Even within a very close team there are bound to be incidences of differing expectations or misunderstandings.

      Having a team charter makes it very clear which shared values the team has agreed to and the type of behaviour acceptable from team members.

      The team charter helps keep everyone on the same page. It also means that when disagreements arise, there are some pre-accepted guidelines which can be referred to so that the diagreement and its resolution are between the team and the charter _not_ between individual team members.

      Getting to a good team culture requires the team to adopt shared behaviours. This takes time to adopt and is only possible if the team have some shared underlying values. Developing a Team Charter is a key step in getting those shared Values in place.

      ## What we learned

      - **Team Charter**
        Defines the team's purpose and expectations.
      - **Project Vision**
        Needs to be clear, but not necessarily detailed.
      - **Team Agreement**
        Should be created _by the team_ not _for the team_.
