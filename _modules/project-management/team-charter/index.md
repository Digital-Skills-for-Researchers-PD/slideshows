      # Team Charter
      _Organising your team_



  - content: |

      - Define purpose of the team
      - Outlines behaviour boundaries
      - Shows team support 
      - Commitment to shared values
      - Cultivates desired team behaviours

    notes: |

      Teams can be fantastic If everyone is pulling in the right directions
      Is so easy for teams to focus on the wrong objectives, fail to treat each other with respect, fail to use each others skills and knowledge

      A team that doesn’t understand its purpose clearly is not going to bond quickly. The purpose could be as simple as “We are an Agile development team who’s purpose is to produce products that satisfy and delight our customers frequently”
      “We are an Agile development team who’s purpose is to increase the innovation in our X product features over the 3 year roadmap”


      Getting to a good team culture requires the team to adopt shared behaviours. This takes time to adopt and is only possible if the team have some shared underlying values. This activity is a key step in getting those shared Values in place.

      Team Charters can also help if the team gets into trouble and needs to be guided back on track.

      Team charters help speed the process of forming, storming, norming and performing.
