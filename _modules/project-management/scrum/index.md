      ## What is Scrum

      
    notes: |

      80’s and 90’s out of OO dev circles as a highly iterative dev method. Ken Schwaber, Jeff Surtherland and Mike Beedle. Focus on management, close monitoring. Scrum is usually combined with XP practices

      Let’s look at how a Scrum project works

      A product owner creates a prioritized wish list called a product backlog. 
      During sprint planning, the team pulls a small chunk from the top of that wishlist, a sprint backlog, and decides how to implement those pieces.  
      The team has a certain amount of time, a sprint, to complete its work - usually two to four weeks - but meets each day to assess its progress (daily scrum). 
      Along the way, the ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on its goal. 
      At the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially shippable, as in ready to hand to a customer, put on a store shelf, or show to a stakeholder.
      The sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective. 
      As the next sprint begins, the team chooses another chunk of the product backlog and begins working again. 

      The cycle repeats until enough items in the product backlog have been completed, the budget is depleted, or a deadline arrives. Which of these milestones marks the end of the work is entirely specific to the project. No matter which impetus stops work, Scrum ensures that the most valuable work has been completed when the project ends.

      ## Roles

    notes: |

      Product Owner:  What to Build
      Business expert, supported by sponsor
      Owns the project vision
      Owns the Product Backlog
      Defines user stories and Acceptance criteria
      Defines relative priority – business value
      Confirms  stories are correctly implemented

      The Development Team:  How to Build it
      Those who turn User Stories into working software
      Cross functional, Multi-disciplined 
      Self-Organising
      Collectively responsible for delivering the product
      Empowered to determine how to deliver
      Optimal size for a Scrum Team is 7 + / - 2

      Scrum Master:  How to Work Together to Build it
      Supports the team and the Agile process
      Coaches the team and the customer
      Removes impediments
      Protects the team from interference
      Assists in tuning and adjusting team behaviour

      There are always trade offs between the roles
      Each role has a different focus
      Yes if resources are tight a team member could act as the SM or PO but
      Be aware that there might be and probably will be a conflict of interest at some
      Point in the project that will need to be handled with care.
      Ideally each role is performed by a different person to avoid conflicts of interest.
