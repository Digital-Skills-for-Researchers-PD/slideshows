      # Scrum

    notes: |

      80’s and 90’s out of OO dev circles as a highly iterative dev method. Ken Schwaber, Jeff Surtherland and Mike Beedle. Focus on management, close monitoring. Scrum is usually combined with XP practices


  - content: |

      Scrum is an iterative method of product development.
      The work is done in cycles, with regular re-prioritisation.


  - content: |

      The point of Scrum, or any iterative product development,
      is to ensure **the most valuable work** is completed by the project's end.

  - content: |

      Backlog -> Sprint Backlog -> Sprint -> Shippable product -> Review and retro


  - content: |

      The **Product Backlog** is a wishlist of work to be done.
      It is owned and managed by the **Product Owner**.

    notes: |

      Briefly define product owner

      A product owner creates a prioritized wish list called a product backlog. 

  - content: |

      The **Sprint Backlog** is a to-do list,
      and is owned by **the Team**.

    notes: |

      During sprint planning, the team pulls a small chunk from the top of that wishlist, a sprint backlog, and decides how to implement those pieces.  


  - content: |

      The **Sprint** is a period of time where the team
      actually _does_ the work, selected from the **Sprint Backlog**.

      A Sprint is usually 1 or 2 weeks long.

    notes: |

      The team has a certain amount of time, a sprint, to complete its work - usually two to four weeks - but meets each day to assess its progress (daily scrum).

      Along the way, the ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on its goal.


  - content: |

      Each Sprint should result in a **Shippable Product**,
      which is an outcome which can be shared with the client.

    notes: |

      At the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially shippable, as in ready to hand to a customer, put on a store shelf, or show to a stakeholder.


  - content: |

      The team's **Retrospective** helps them to discuss how the sprint went,
      and whether any improvements could be considered for next sprint.

    notes: |

      The sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective. 
      As the next sprint begins, the team chooses another chunk of the product backlog and begins working again.


  - content: |

      This cycle repeats until the project reaches its end.
      
      The "end" of a project could be defined as:

      - The Product Backlog has been completed
      - There is no budget remaining
      - A deadline has been reached

    notes: |

      The cycle repeats until enough items in the product backlog have been completed, the budget is depleted, or a deadline arrives. Which of these milestones marks the end of the work is entirely specific to the project. No matter which impetus stops work, Scrum ensures that the most valuable work has been completed when the project ends.

      ## What we learned

      - **Scrum**
        is an iterative development method
      - **Sprints**
        Work is divided into a series of timeboxed sprints
      - **Shippable Product**
        Critial work goes first, and the product evolves through usable forms.
