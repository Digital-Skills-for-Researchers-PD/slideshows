      ## Science has a replication/reproducibility issue  
      {:.center-aligned}

      ### Many fields
      * Economics
      * Psychology
      * Biology

    notes:
      Many fields have studies reporting very low replication rates

      ## Course Aims
      By the end of this course you should have the knowledge and skills to publish reproducible science research

      note: (and hopefully some of you will, in fact, do that)



  - content: |
      ## Course Philosophy
      * Assessed on personal progress, not relative to peers
      * Skills are means to an ends, not the goal
      * Point 3


  - content: |
      ## Course Structure
      * 11 modules
      * First half of the course: technical skills
      * Second half: more conceptual, using skills learnt in first half
      * Ongoing assignments and working on your project

<!--
Science has a replication/reproducibility issue
Many studies across many fields reporting low success rates for replication
<50%

We have the technology
Computation has becoming an increasingly large part of the scientific process
Data collection and storage, processing, analysis, visualization and conclusion all depend more and more on computation  

Our research should be reproducible

This can feel daunting. Making our work visible to everyone else sounds like a scary proposition.

The Structure of the course

11 Modules covering project management, data management, computing, visualization, sharing, licensing and publishing. Learn how to integrate these skills together into a scientific work flow. During the course you will apply what you are learning to your project, working so that is (100%) reproducible science. The focus of this course is as much on creating reproducible workflows as it is the individual tools and skills that go into creating those workflows.
