      ## Science has a <br> replication/reproducibility issue  
      {:.center-aligned}

      ### Many fields
      * Economics
      * Psychology
      * Biology

    notes: 
      Many fields have studies reporting very low replication rates

      ## We have the technology

      Computation has becoming an increasingly large part of the scientific process
      Data collection and storage, processing, analyses, visualization and conclusion all depend more and more on computation

      ## Course Aims
      By the end of this course you should have the knowledge 
      and skills to publish reproducible science research. 

      (and some of you may actually publish!)

      ## Course Philosophy

      You will be assessed on personal progress, 
      not assessed relative to your peers.

      Skills are means to an ends, not the goal.

      ## Course Structure

      * 9 modules
      * Fist half of the course is technical skills
      * Second half is more conceptual, using skills learnt in the first half
      * Ongoing assignments and work on your project

<!-- 
Science has a replication/reproducibility issue
Many studies across many fields reporting low success rates for replication
<50%



Our research should be reproducible

This can feel daunting. Making our work visible to everyone else sounds like a scary proposition.

The Structure of the course

11 Modules covering project management, data management, computing, visualization, sharing, licensing and publishing. Learn how to integrate these skills together into a scientific work flow. During the course you will apply what you are learning to your project, working so that is (100%) reproducible science. The focus of this course is as much on creating reproducible workflows as it is the individual tools and skills that go into creating those worlflows.
