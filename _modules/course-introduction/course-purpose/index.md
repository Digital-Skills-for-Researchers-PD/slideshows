        # Course Purpose
        _Why are we even here?_


    - content: |

        ## Science has a replication/reproducibility issue

        ### Many fields
        * Economics
        * Psychology
        * Biology

    - notes: |
         Many fields have studies reporting very low replication rates

<!-- 
Science has a replication/reproducibility issue
Many studies across many fields reporting low success rates for replication
<50%

We have the technology
Computation has becoming an increasingly large part of the scientific process
Data collection and storage, processing, analyses, visualization and conclusion all depend more and more on computation  

Our research should be reproducible


The Structure of the course

11 Modules covering project management, data management, computing, visualization, sharing, licensing and publishing. Learn how to integrate these skills together into a scientific work flow. During the course you will apply what you are learning to your project, working so that is (100%) reproducible science. The focus of this course is as much on creating reproducible workflows as it is the individual tools and skills that go into creating those worlflows.
